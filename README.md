# SportWave
SportWave is an online store for sport clothes. There are three types of users:
- Normal users: They can make orders and manage them from the order section that they have (see if order has been sent or mark it as shipped), write reviews for the products, manage their accounts by changing their passwords.
- Admin user: The admin is the first registered user. He can pretty much anything. There is a staff section where he can add products, clothes categories, promo codes, manage employees (add new ones/remove them),
manage orders (mark them as sent/see when they are shipped of the users mark them as such), manage promo codes (make them valid or invalid). From the men and women pages he can also edit the information about the product,
stock up the product, remove it or make orders and write reviews as a normal user.
- Employee users: The employees are meant to help the admin and they have the same functionality except for managing employees (add new ones/remove current ones).
- The admin and employees have a group chat where they can connect with each other.
